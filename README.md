## Background

HYB_FW_PDF, is a **hybrid framework** (Combination of **Data driven** and **Keyword**) along with **PDF reporting**.  One reason I created this project because there is a lack of complete end to end solution for a **Testing Framework** and people struggle to get **PDF** reports for the completed tasks (**in testing perspective**).

Framework is built in : [Eclipse Neon IDE (For Java Developers)](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/neon/3/eclipse-ide-java-developers)<br>
