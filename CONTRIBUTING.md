:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1: 

Thanks for checking out the HYB_FW_PDF(Hybrid Framework With PDF Reporting)! I am excited to hear and learn from you. Your experiences will benefit others **testers** who use this framework for their implementation.

## Types of contributions I am looking for
There are many ways you can directly contribute to the code (in descending order of need):

* Fix minor bugs, add unattended exceptions
* Add/ extend the code with new/improved possibilities

Interested in making a contribution? Read on!

## Ground rules & expectations

Before I get started, here are a few things I expect from you (and that you should expect from others):

* Be kind and thoughtful in your conversations around this project. We all come from different backgrounds and projects, which means we likely have different perspectives on "how open source is done." Try to listen to others rather than convince them that your way is correct.
* HYB_FW_PDF is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating in this project, you agree to abide by its terms.
* If you open a pull request, please ensure that your contribution passes all tests. If there are test failures, you will need to address them before we can merge your contribution.
* When adding content, please consider if it is widely valuable. Please don't add references or links to things you or your employer have created as others will do so if they appreciate it.

## How to contribute

If you'd like to contribute, start by searching through the [issues](https://github.com/suneel944/HYB_FW_PDF/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/suneel944/HYB_FW_PDF/pulls) to see whether someone else has raised a similar idea or question.

If you don't see your idea listed, and you think it fits into the goals of this guide, do one of the following:
* **If your contribution is minor,** such as a typo fix, open a pull request.
* **If your contribution is major,** such as addition of new code or improving the existing code efficiency, start by opening an issue first. That way, other people can weigh in on the discussion before you do any work.
